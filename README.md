Motivation

Why Tekjoin?

There is an acute gap of communication amongst students and professionals belonging to the same organisation or institution. Formally, to identify and communicate with an acquaintance sharing similar views, having the same skills and interests is a challenging task. To reduce this widening gap, the idea of Tekjoin was conceived. Tekjoin is a platform which connects employee to employee, unlike many other applications who promulgate employer to employee connection. This is what makes Tekjoin different from its peers functioning in the same domain. 

Description

Tekjoin is a web-based application which aims to connect users sharing similar technical vestments.
Users are provided with the feature of creating their own account, updating their personal profile information and also modifying their own technical fields.
Based on each user’s selected technical attributes, Tekjoin matches them with other users having mutual common fields. The mutual users then have the luxury of accepting the request and adding each other to their own private dossier of friends. Mutual friends have the option to contact and connive through the personal chat facility provided exclusively for the dossier of the user’s friends.
A digital notice board, a working version of post-it notes in also provided for users to share information to all featured members. Additionally, to aid global communication, a ‘discussions’ room is provided for all active users to debate and discourse over currently trending topics in the discussion room.

Future Scope

Currently Tekjoin is deployed on a scale for roughly 20 users. In wider perspectives, it can be extended to accommodate the college. Growing as a platform for students who want to invest in colleague’s sharing their opinions and willing to contribute in projects.
From Students, a transition to the industry can be obtained and working-class professionals can use this application to browse for personnel technically oriented towards each other.


Challenges/Limitations

Major pre-existing competitors provide strong competition to Tekjoin. However primarily different in their inherent purpose, similar apps can be a major ramification on the path for Tekjoin.
To overcome these challenges, it is imperative that the driving idea behind Tekjoin is convalesced to the masses at large. Better design, performance and functionality will aid Tekjoin outshine its peers and rivals.
